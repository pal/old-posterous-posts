Lately I've been totally absorbed by <a href="http://www.wow-europe.com/en/">World of Warcraft</a>. I've been playing quite a lot since I got the game, and I had to reroll after a while since Ida, my girlfriend also got hooked! ;) Deliveries was out in Europe, so I got a copy off <a href="http://search.ebay.com/warcraft-europe-cd">eBay</a>.

If you're playing en Spinebreaker in the EU, whisper to <em>Skalman</em> and you can join <a href="http://warcraftrealms.com/guilddisplay.php?serverid=376&amp;guildname=they+might+be+giants">our clan, They Might Be Giants</a>! :)

Also, don't forget to get the <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/">Firefox</a> search plugin for searching <a href="http://thottbot.com/">thottbot</a>, you can <a href="http://www.netdesign.net/~kitae/wow/thottbotplugin.html">find it here</a>.

Happy hunting!
