I have never really been into the <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/mozilla1.x/">Mozilla Suite</a>. I did however use the Mozilla Browser early on, and I wouldn't go back to surfing without <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/">Firefox</a>, or reading email outside of <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/thunderbird/">Thunderbird</a>.

I seems more people think this way. <a href="http://www.zdnet.com.au/news/software/0,2000061733,39184047,00.htm">As reported by ZDNet</a> last thursday, the Mozilla Foundation was thinking about giving up the suite, and going for the single applications instead. <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/seamonkey-transition.html">Now they made up their minds.</a>

<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">The 1.7.x line will be the last set of Seamonkey products released and maintained by the Mozilla Foundation. The Mozilla Foundation will provide infrastructure for those interested in working on the 1.7.x releases, which we expect will include a number of vendors who provide these products to their customers.</blockquote>

No worries though, the volunteers have already stepped in, and in the best of worlds, the only user-visible change will be a change in names. New name: <a href="http://wiki.mozilla.org/wiki/SeaMonkey:Home_Page">SeaMonkey Suite</a>.
