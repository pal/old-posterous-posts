I've been looking at the <a href="http://java-gnome.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/bin/view">Java-GNOME</a> packages before, but they never compiled for me so I decided to wait a bit longer.

I have been on the announce-list though, and today they announced version 2.10.0. While looking over their site for what's new, I found this link to a sweet Flash-based demo of how to use Glade to design a GUI, Eclipse to code in and Java-GNOME to connect the dots.

Looks promising, and I'll have to give this a spin when I find some free time!
