Just finished my PDF plugin (that's not really a plugin) for <a href="http://www.jspwiki.org/">JSPWiki</a>.

It's a servlet that's just used to export a Wiki page as a PDF file. I'm using Apache FOP, the Java bindings for Tidy and Sun's JIMI to accomplish this. Most work was done by other people, I just put it together and take credit.

Have a look at <a href="http://www.jspwiki.org/Wiki.jsp?page=PDFPlugin">the PDFPlugin page at JSPWiki</a>!
